The only foe you've dropped is my expectations.
You must have worked hard to be this incompetent.
I'd call you a complete moron but I think you're missing a few screws.
I've seen mushrooms with more charm.
If I could save a child's life by sparing you I'd have to think about it.
I wish we were better strangers.
You look like you lost a fight with a rake.
I'd say you're dumb as a rock, but rocks offer better conversation.
Believe in yourself, because no one else does.
Why don't you slip into something more comfortable like a coma?
You couldn't hit the broad side of your mother's ass.
With a face like that, you'd make a lovely corpse.
Go deepthroat a cactus.
How about you play a nice game of hide and go fuck yourself.
I'd shoot you but I wouldn't wish that on any arrow.
You're why parents beat their children.
You look like your face was on fire and someone tried to put it out with an ice pick.
You remind me of Rapunzel, except instead of letting your hair down you let your everyone else down.
We all make mistakes. I'm sure your parents are good people.
Your parents should've known better.
Anyone who ever loved you was wrong.
If you were any more inbred you'd be a sandwich.
So what flew faster? Your arrows, or your family leaving you?
My blows avoid you just like everyone else in your life.
If you were on fire I wouldn't piss on you to put it out.
You're about as useful as teets on a breastplate.
When you were young your home tried to run away from you.
When you played hide and seek as a kid no one looked for you.
Two wrongs don't make a right. Ask your parents.
Hey, even gods make mistakes.
You must've been born drunk.
After seeing your face I'm considering taking up drinking.
You're what happens when God rolls a 1.
If a princess kisses you will you stop being a bitch?
